# About
A Django web application to display sensor data on a map and allow comparison with regional estimates.
All data is loaded into the web app's database by the (admin) user at run-time, from 4 CSV files 
which comprise 2 data files and 2 metadata files. 
Example data files are provided in the `/examples` folder.  

Regional estimates can also be calculated at run-time. The estimation methods 
are those available in the python library: https://pypi.org/project/region-estimators 
('concentric-regions' and 'distance-simple' at time of writing)

Users can also upload their own data locally (within a browser session), 
again via a CSV file upload, allowing their own data to be compared alongside the 
actuals/estimates data pre-loaded by admin.

# User instructions

See our [user instructions readme](README_instructions.md) for general and admin user instructions on
how to use this web application
(and try this out on our example deployment: [mine-the-gaps](http://minethegaps.manchester.ac.uk/))


# Install and test locally
The following instructions are to get this Django web app running on any machine, using a browser
and localhost.

## Clone this repository 
Make a copy of this code on your computer by:

`cd ~/Code/` [cd to a folder on your local machine where you would like to install this code]

and then either:

`git clone  https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/mine-the-gaps.git`

or:

 click on 'Code' on this github repository homepage, then 'Download ZIP' and save to your chosen folder.
 Then extract this zip file.

## QUICK START (Makefile) Instructions 
These instructions are for Linux, Mac OS and Windows Sub-system Linux users only. We have created a Makefile which 
you can easily call from the shell. It runs a docker container which runs the Mine-the-Gaps web app, accessible from 
a browser, at localhost.

### Open a shell/command prompt and check you are in the mine-the-gaps project directory:
`cd [folder into which you cloned the mine-the-gaps code]/mine-the-gaps`
You should be in the same folder as the `Makefile` file.

### Call the Makefile to start the app
`make docker-serve`\
This installs and runs the app on localhost.

### Check the app is running
Open a browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` . You should see the mine-the-gaps web app running, but with no
data. (You may need to wait a few seconds and/or refresh the browser.)

### Set up super-users (admin users) on the web app (after Makefile/docker quick installation)
To load data into the mine-the-gaps app, an admin user is required. To set up an 
admin user (aka superuser), we need to run the Django management tool (which runs within the docker container). 
Run:\
`docker-compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser`\
This will ask several questions via the command line. Once the superuser is set up,
that user can log in to the web application.

### Log in as superuser and upload data
Return to the web application on your browser (`localhost:8000`) and click on `admin login` in the 
top right-hand side of the main page.  Use the new admin log-in credentials to log in.

See our [instructions for admin users](README_instructions.md#admin-users) for admin user instructions 
on how to use this web application, including how to upload data.

### Further details when using the Quick Start set-up (using Makefile and docker)

The docker containers will now run in the background (`-d` specifies run as detached process) 
until they are stopped.

To see a list of all running containers, run either:\
`docker ps`\
or\
`docker container ls`

If both containers are running as expected, the output should show the two containers running: 
one for the `mine-the-gaps_webapp` and another for a `postgis` database image.
The output should look something like:
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES
88a4aeebe9a8   mine-the-gaps_web   "/entrypoint /start"     56 minutes ago   Up 56 minutes   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp, :::8000->8000/tcp   mine-the-gaps_web_1
31f5a454ff2b   postgis/postgis      "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   56 minutes ago   Up 56 minutes   5432/tcp                                    mine-the-gaps_db_1
```
If the output does not look like above, then try running:\
`docker-compose logs -f`\
which gives you a detailed log file, showing all logs, including errors, for both containers.

To stop the docker container run:\
`docker-compose  down`\
or \
`make docker-stop`\
*Note that in the current set-up, once the container is stopped, any admin users and loaded data 
(added using instructions below) will be lost.*

To clean out the docker settings files run:\
`make clean`

To clean out the docker settings files and the Secret Key, run:\
`make clean-all`

To create a new settings file, run:\
`make settings`\
Alternatively, you can open the `/geo_sensor_gaps/settings/local.py` file to set the `SECRET_KEY` and the 
`MAX_NUM_PROCESSORS` settings.

To create a new secret key for docker (stored in text file), run:\
`make keys`\
Alternatively: 
1) you can open the `/geo_sensor_gaps/settings/local.py` file to set the `SECRET_KEY` setting.
2) you can update the secret key in the file `keystring.txt`.

To set the maximum number of processors to be used:\
Open the `/geo_sensor_gaps/settings/local.py` file to set the `MAX_NUM_PROCESSORS` setting.

To access the web app's source code, run:\
`docker exec -it mine-the-gaps_web_1 /bin/bash`\
*Note: `mine-the-gaps_web_1` should match the `NAME` of the container, listed when you get the list
of all running containers (see above).*


## Instructions for full database and Django set-up (NOT using Makefile / Docker)
  
  These instructions are based on the Ubuntu OS. They will need to be adapted to run on other Linux distributions,
  Windows and other OSs.

  This web app is tested on python versions 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y libproj-dev libgeos-dev gdal-bin libgdal-dev libsqlite3-mod-spatialite
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip

### Virtual Environment

See https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html for instruction on how to set up a virtual environment 
(recommended). This virtual environment will hold the required version of Python, Django and other 
necessary modules.

To activate your new virtual environment run:

`source venv/bin/activate` [Replace 'venv' with the path to your new virtual environment]
      
### Install Django and additional modules. 

Ensure that your newly created virtual environment is activated (see above), and then run:

    cd [code-directory] [Replace [code-directory] with the path of the project folder that contains requirements.txt]
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Install the PostGIS (Spatial PostreSQL database)
As this web app requires geographical functionality, we can't rely only on Django's default
database set-up. We require a database that can hold and process geo-spatial data and 
PostGIS is used for this purpose.
For general documentation on PostGIS see https://postgis.net/docs/

Within the above instructions, there are installation instructions found at: 
https://postgis.net/docs/postgis_installation.html#install_short_version

For instructions on using PostGIS with Django:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/contrib/gis/install/postgis/

### Add a .envs file

Using the `mine-the-gaps/settings/.env.template`, copy this file to `mine-the-gaps/settings/.env`
then fill in the `SECRET_KEY` value with a newly generated key (string) 
(e.g try this online key generator https://djecrety.ir/)

Fill in the other database log-in values with your own: Replace the NAME, USER and PASSWORD values with 
those set up when you created your  PostGIS database in previous step.

```text
GEO_SENSOR_GAPS_SECRET_KEY=[INSERT_YOUR_SECRET_KEY]
GEO_SENSOR_GAPS_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost 127.0.0.1 [::1]
GEO_SENSOR_GAPS_SQL_DATABASE=geo_sensor_gaps [OR REPLACE WITH YOUR DB NAME]
GEO_SENSOR_GAPS_SQL_USER=geo_sensor_gaps_user [OR REPLACE WITH YOUR DB USER NAME]
GEO_SENSOR_GAPS_SQL_PASSWORD=[INSERT_YOUR_DB_PASSWORD]
GEO_SENSOR_GAPS_SQL_HOST=localhost
```

### Check Django installation
Ensure your new virtual environment is activated, and then you can check Django is installed using the following
online set-up instructions.

*Note that Django has already been installed in the previous step*
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/install/


### Run the development server
Ensure that the new virtual environment is activated and run:

 `cd [code-directory]` [Replace [code-directory] with the path of the project folder that contains requirements.txt]

optional test:\
`python manage.py test`\
and run:\
`python manage.py runserver`

The output to the last command should be similar to:

```shell
$ python manage.py runserver

Django version 3.2.5, using settings 'mine-the-gaps.settings.dev'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```
Using your browser, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (or the link shown in your output) and this should 
open up the web-application. *Note that no data has been loaded yet, so the map will be empty.*

### Set up super-users (admin users) on the web app (when not using Makefile / docker install)
To load data into the mine-the-gaps app, an admin user is required. To set up an 
admin user (aka superuser), we need to run the Django management tool (which runs within the docker container). 
Run:\
`python manage.py createsuperuser`\
This will ask several questions via the command line. Once the superuser is set up,
that user can log in to the web application.

### Log in as superuser and upload data
Return to the web application on your browser (`localhost:8000`) and click on `admin login` in the 
top right-hand side of the main page.  Use the new admin log-in credentials to log in.

See our [instructions for admin users](README_instructions.md#admin-users) for admin user instructions 
on how to use this web application, including how to upload data.
